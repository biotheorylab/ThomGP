Since this notation is quite sparse --- it uses only two primitive operations, \(\mathcal{D}\) and \(\mathbb{E}\) --- in actual practice, one would likely want to augment it with further symbols, abbreviations and "syntactic sugar".  The main purpose of this exercise is to be able to express things in a consistent way and provide a common ground for defining and comparing statements written in different local dialects.  For simplicity, we will assume that our sets are finite, but one can extend the notation to more advanced situations by taking into account considerations of convergence and measure.</span></span></h2></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="as-a-starting-point,-we-have-a-sample-space-\(x-=-(s,-e)\),-where-\(s\)-is-a-set-and-\(e\)-is-a-boolean-lattice-of-subsets-of-\(s\)-----when-\(s\)-is-finite,-\(s-=-2^s\),-the-powerset-lattice--one-often-calls-elements-of-\(s\)-outcomes-and-calls-elements-of-\(e\)-events--we-will-build-up-structure-by-introducing-classes-of-functions"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>As a starting point, we have a sample space \(X = (S, E)\), where \(S\) is a set and \(E\) is a Boolean lattice of subsets of \(S\) --- when \(S\) is finite, \(S = 2^S\), the powerset lattice.

Given enough such mappings, we may specify any outcome in our space by the values of these variables and specify any event by specifying a relation between the variables.
