We did a first read through.  We will revisit after reading the rest of the paper so we can understand exactly what has been introduced.
*** II.  we introduce those models, along with a few important concepts to analyze them, and we define the mesoscopic variables that will be relevant in the large-volume limit
*** III.  we take the large-volume limit and show that the dynamics of those systems can be described through a path integral with a Lagrangian that can be computed explicitly
*** IV.
**** 1) we apply said formalism to compute the scaled cumulant generating (SCGF) function of currents and densities of our models, which is the Legendre transform of the large deviation function of station- ary currents and densities
**** 2) show that systems whose deterministic equations have several attractors (i.e., that are multistable) generically undergo first-order dynamical phase transitions around small values of the dynamical biases
*** V. we illustrate this last result by exhibiting a few of
those dynamical phase transitions in variants of a simple bistable system called the Schlögl model
*** VI. hands-on summary of how one may compute large deviation functions of dynamical observables in a chemical reaction network, meant as a quick reference or a minimal guide to readers who may wish to skip the details of the derivations
