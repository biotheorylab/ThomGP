#+TITLE: Method of Characteristics

** Here we will describe the method of charactericstics for solving first-order partial differential equations.  We will start simple and gradually build in generality by reducing more complicated equations to simpler equations which we have already solved
** Linear equations
** Quasi-linear equations
** LATER Non-linear equations
