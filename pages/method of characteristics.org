#+TITLE: Method of Characteristics

** Here we will describe the method of charactericstics for solving first-order partial differential equations.  We will start simple and gradually build in generality by reducing more complicated equations to simpler equations which we have already solved
** Linear equations
** Quasi-linear equations
** Non-linear equations

Now we generalize to non-linear equations of the form
\[ H\left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial q_{\cdot}}, q_{\cdot} \right) = 0.\]
To reduce such an equation to a quasilinear equation, we introduce new variables \(p_{i}\) and equations \(p_{i} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial q_{i}}\).  Taking the derivative of the original equation and substituting, we find that
\[ \sum_{i} \frac{\partial H(p_{\cdot}, q_{\cdot})}{\partial p_i} \frac{\partial p_i}{\partial q_{j}} + \frac{\partial H(p_{\cdot}, q_{\cdot})}{\partial q_{j}} = 0\]
Differentiating the new equations and combining, we obtain the integrability conditions
\[\frac{\partial p_{i}}{\partial q_{j}} =  \frac{\partial p_{j}}{\partial q_{i}}.\]

The equations we have just derived are quasi-linear.  Furthermore, we claim that, locally, solutions of these equations are equivalent
