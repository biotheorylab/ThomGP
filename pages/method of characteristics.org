#+TITLE: Method of Characteristics

** Here we will describe the method of charactericstics for solving first-order partial differential equations.  We will start simple and gradually build in generality by reducing more complicated equations to simpler equations which we have already solved
** Linear equations
** Quasi-linear equations
** Non-linear equations

Now we generalize to non-linear equations of the form
\[ H\left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial q_{\cdot}}, q_{\cdot} \right) = 0.\]
