#+TITLE: Continuous-time Markov processes

** Definition
*** The probability of finding a system in state $n$ at time $\tau$ can be represented by the joint probability distribution $$p(\tau, n)$$. Noting that this distribution is defined at a particular time, and requiring the same system to have visited a state $n_0$ at time $t_0 \lt \tau$, we may consider the /conditional probability/ $p(\tau, n \vert t_0, n_0)$, which will also be referred to as the /transition probability/ for Markov processes. As is well known, /Markov/, corresponds to the condition that $p(t, n \vert \tau_k, m_k) = p(t, n \vert \tau_k, m_k; \cdots ; \tau_1, m_1 ; t_0, n_0)$ for $t \gt \tau_k \gt \tau_{k-1}, \ldots, t_0$.
