#+TITLE: Continuous-time Markov processes

** The probability of finding a system in state $n$ at time $\tau$ can be represented by the joint probability distribution $$p(\tau, n)$$. Noting that this distribution is defined at a particular time, and requiring the system to have visited a state $n_0$ at time $t_0 \lt \tau$,
