* It is a simple stochastic process that models radioactive decay and is generated by the following reaction:
**
$$ \begin{aligned}
    &Death: & A 
        &\mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{k_D} \emptyset \\
\end{aligned}$$
** The process is part of the Birth-Death or one step processes family. Only jumps between adjacent states are permitted. The master equation is given by:
***
$$ \begin{aligned}\frac{dP(n,t)}{dt} &= 
        \sum_{m \in \mathbb{N}} T_{m|n} P(n,t) \\ &=
        k_D \, (n+1) P(n+1, t)  -
        k_D \, n  P(n, t)\end{aligned}$$
*** As is linear, the mean field equation can be found by multiplying both sides by n a summing over n  and shifting the indices:
****
$$\begin{aligned} n\frac{dP(n,t)}{dt} &= n\left( 
        k_D \, (n+1) P(n+1, t)  -
        k_D \, n  P(n, t) \right) \\ \sum n\frac{dP(n,t)}{dt} &= k_D\sum n
         \, (n+1) P(n+1, t)  - k_D\sum         \, n^2  P(n, t) \\ &= k_D\sum n
         \, (n-1) P(n, t)  - k_D\sum         \, n^2  P(n, t) \\ &= -k_D\sum n
         \,  P(n, t)  \\ \frac{d}{dt}E(N(t)) &= -k_DE(N(t))\end{aligned}$$
