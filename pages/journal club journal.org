#+TITLE: Journal Club Journal

** This page is meant as as a sort of journal for keeping track of our progress in journal club activities studying literature related to theoretical biology and adjacent subjects.
** Main works --- These are the works we are studying in detail to understand ideas and techniques which we hope to build upon and make use of in our work.
*** NOW [[Intrinsic and Extrinsic Thermodynamics for Stochastic Population Processes with Multi-Level Large-Deviation Structure by Eric Smith in 2020]]
