#+TITLE: Journal Club Journal

** This page is meant as as a sort of journal for keeping track of our progress in journal club activities studying literature related to theoretical biology and adjacent subjects.
** Main works --- These are the works we are studying in detail to understand ideas and techniques which we hope to build upon and make use of in our work.
*** NOW [[Intrinsic and Extrinsic Thermodynamics for Stochastic Population Processes with Multi-Level Large-Deviation Structure by Eric Smith in 2020]]  We have finished a preliminary verbatim read and are now focusing on specific topics.

*** LATER Smith, E., & Krishnamurthy, S. (2011). Bridging scales with generating functions and the large-deviations analysis of stochastic evolutionary game theory. http://www.santafe.edu/~desmith/PDF_pubs/evo_games_LDP.pdf  We have already perused this in the past but could bring our understanding to a new level by integrating what we have learned in the meanwhile, especially from our study related to "Intrinsic and Extrinsic Thermodynamics".

** Auxiliary literature  --- Along the way, we read other works which provide backround, explain concepts, illustrate by example, and fill in details on topics discussed in the main works.

*** DONE Krishnamurthy, S., & Smith, E. (2017). Solving Moment Hierarchies for Chemical Reaction Networks. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01364.pdf  Reading the  first part helped clarify the notation for reaction networks.  At some later date, we might want to look at the examples more closely, build intuition for factorial moments, and study moment hierarchies.
