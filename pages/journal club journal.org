#+TITLE: Journal Club Journal

** This page is meant as as a sort of journal for keeping track of our progress in journal club activities studying literature related to theoretical biology and adjacent subjects.
** Main works --- These are the works we are studying in detail to understand ideas and techniques which we hope to build upon and make use of in our work.
*** NOW [[Intrinsic and Extrinsic Thermodynamics for Stochastic Population Processes with Multi-Level Large-Deviation Structure by Eric Smith in 2020]]  We have finished a preliminary verbatim read and are now focusing on specific topics.

Bridging scales with generating functions and the large-deviations analysis of stochastic evolutionary game theory. http://www.santafe.edu/~desmith/PDF_pubs/evo_games_LDP.pdf  We have already perused this in the past but could bring our understanding to a new level by integrating what we have learned in the meanwhile, especially

** Auxiliary literature  --- Along the way, we read other works which provide backround, explain concepts, illustrate by example, and fill in details on topics discussed in the main works.
