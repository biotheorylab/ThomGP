#+TITLE: Asymptotic series

** Taylor series
*** at $a=0$ (i.e. Maclaurin series)
**** $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} f^{(n)}(0) x^n$
**** $f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{1}{2}f''(0)x^2 + \frac{1}{6}f'''(0)x^3 + \cdots$
*** at arbitrary $a$
**** $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} f^{(n)}(a) (x-a)^n$
** A typical way of approximating a function is by concocting a power series.  (For concreteness, let \(f \colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}\) denote the function we are interested in approximating.) Once we have done this, we ask under what conditions the power series provides a useable approximation to \(f\).  There are several posibilities.
*** In the most favorable case, the series converges for all \(x \in \mathbb{C}\).  This means that, for any argument \(x \in \mathbb{C}\) and any tolerance \(\epsilon \in \mathbb{R_{+}}\), there exists a natural number \(N\) such that all partial sums of the series with at least \(N\) terms approximate \(f(x)\) within \(\epsilon\).  Symbolically,
\[\forall x \in \mathbb{C} \mathop{.}. \forall \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}_{+} . \exists N \in \mathbb{N} . \forall n \in \mathbb{N} . n \ge N \Rightarrow\]
