#+TITLE: Asymptotic series

** Taylor series
*** at $a=0$ (i.e. Maclaurin series)
**** $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} f^{(n)}(0) x^n$
**** $f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{1}{2}f''(0)x^2 + \frac{1}{6}f'''(0)x^3 + \cdots$
*** at arbitrary $a$
**** $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} f^{(n)}(a) (x-a)^n$
** A typical way of approximating a function is by concocting a power series.  (For concreteness, let \(f \colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}\) denote the function we are interested in approximating.) Once we have done this, we ask under what conditions the power series provides a useable approximation to \(f\).  There are several posibilities.
*** In the most favorable case, the series converges for all \(x \in \mathbb{C}\).  This means that, for any argument \(x \in \mathbb{C}\) and any tolerance \(\epsilon \in \mathbb{R_{+}}\), there exists a natural number \(n\) such that all partial sums of the series with at least \(N\) terms approximate \(f(x)\) within \(\epsilon\).  Symbolically,

\[\forall x \in \mathbb{C} ~.~~ \forall \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}_{+} ~.~ \exists n \in \mathbb{N} ~.~ \forall k \in \mathbb{N} ~.~ k \ge n \Rightarrow \left| f(x) - \sum_{j=0}^{k} c_j x^j \right| \le \epsilon\]
A famaliar casee is when \(f(x) = e^{x})
