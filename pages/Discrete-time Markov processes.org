* Here we systematically explain the theory of discrete-time Markov processes. For simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to finite state spaces.
* Let $S$ denote the state space, which, for now, will be a finite set.  Define the set of $n$-step histories as $H_{n} = \mathsf{Map}(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots n\}, S)$.
